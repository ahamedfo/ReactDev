vanilla JS is very step by step

React akes the multiple lines we would have written explicitly and performs the actions implicitly. "You want to create an H1 in this root? no problem, i'll handle it's creation and classes under the hood."

JSX allows us this flexibility thorugh writing html in the JS

Before to affect the HTML in JS, we had to write much more to affect HTML in JS whereas JSX allows us to essentially just write the HTML.!

2 child elements cannot be rendered at 1 time using react. There must always be an overarching parent element. below for example, these could be wrapped in a Div
